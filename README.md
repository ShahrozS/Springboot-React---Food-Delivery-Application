# Full Stack Food Delivery Application
## Made using Java Spring boot, ReactJS with Tailwind CSS and PostgreSQL

A full fledge food delivery application where an admin can manage food items, categories, users, delivery drivers.
An admin can also select orders and assign them available drivers to ship it.

A user can Order food, see his previous orders, manage his accounts, write reviews and give ratings.

Used Spring boot as it is highly scalable and robust with no match in developing of transactions and payments. Spring provides
High security and the way it maps objects to the database made me use spring boot.

And I have used react as it allows me to do component based development so that I can break my applcaiton into several modules(components) and develop them.
